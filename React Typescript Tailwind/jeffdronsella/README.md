# JeffDronsella.com website made with React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite

This website was made as an excercise in programming in React using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## What went well

I found that the basic site structure and styling were pretty easy to achieve with React and Tailwind.  Since the website is very simple I didn't need to use any of the more advanced features of React.  It took me a bit to get used to how Tailwind reacts to different screen sizes, but it didn't take too long to get it working on the phone and on the big screen.

## Challenges

I was getting a 404 on reload for any route other than the root.  After a bit of research I found a tutorial on how to fix it using the .htaccess file.  Once I added the necessary lines, the problem was fixed.
