# JeffDronsella.com made using React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite

This website was made as an excercise in programming in React using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## What went well

I found that the basic site structure and styling were pretty easy to achieve with React and Tailwind.  Since the website is very simple I didn't need to use any of the more advanced features of React.  It took me a bit to get used to how Tailwind reacts to different screen sizes, but it didn't take too long to get it working on the phone and on the big screen.

## Challenges

I was getting a 404 on reload for any route other than the root.  After a bit of research I found a tutorial on how to fix it using the .htaccess file.  Once I added the necessary lines, the problem was fixed.

## Conclusion

My first attempt at this site was in Wordpress.  The designer and editors are very limited and I had a hard time formatting just about everything.  I got the basic design in and deployed and pretty much gave up.  

For my second attempt I tried using React with Next JS, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.  It didn't take long at all to get the site looking and working great.  I did have a lot of trouble deploying it, and I would have had some trouble maintaining it as well due to the folder names changing when I made changes to the site and rebuilt.

This was my third attempt where I used React with Typescript and Tailwind CSS.  I created the project using Vite.  I was able to pretty much cut and paste most of my code from the Next JS version of the site.  I added React Router and got everything up and running quickly.  The deployment was very straightforward and simple.  This would be my go to choice for any future websites with simpler requirments.
