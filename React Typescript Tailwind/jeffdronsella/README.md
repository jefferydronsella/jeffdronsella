# JeffDronsella.com made using React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite

This website was made as an excercise in programming in React using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## The Story of JeffDronsella.com

My first attempt at this site was in Wordpress.  I was able to get the first 90% up and running pretty quickly.  The last 10% was quite challenging.  When it was finished, there were still a couple of things I wasn't quite happy with.  I decided to try building the site in React to see if it would be easier to get everything looking just a bit better.

For my second attempt I tried using React with Next JS, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.  It didn't take long at all to get the site looking and working great.  Once I compiled it to a static site, I realized the complexity of the file structure.  Since this is a very simple site with very little routing, I decided that the advantages of Next JS routing were outweighed by the difficulty in distributing even small changes.  I decided to try it again without Next JS.

On the third attempt at building the site, I used React with Typescript and Tailwind CSS.  I created the project using Vite.  I was able to pretty much cut and paste most of my code from the Next JS version of the site.  I added React Router and got everything up and running quickly.  The deployment was very straightforward and simple.  

## What went well

I found that the basic site structure and styling were pretty easy to achieve with React and Tailwind.  Since the website is very simple I didn't need to use any of the more advanced features of React.  It took me a bit to get used to how Tailwind reacts to different screen sizes, but it didn't take too long to get it working on the phone and on the big screen.

## Challenges

I was getting a 404 on reload for any route other than the root.  After a bit of research I found a tutorial on how to fix it using the .htaccess file.  Once I added the necessary lines, the problem was fixed.

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed making the website using React.  With Tailwind CSS, the styling was easy.  Making the screen look good on a phone required some creative thinking, but in the end I was able to get everything to work.  This combination of tools would be my go to choice for any future websites with simpler requirments.
